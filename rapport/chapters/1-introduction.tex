\section{Introduksjon}

The Community of Practice in Computer Science Education at NTNU (CoPCSE\-$@$NTNU)\footnote{\url{https://www.ntnu.no/wiki/display/copcse/Community+of+Practice+in+Computer+Science+Education+Home}} is hereby offering a template that should in principle be applicable for reports at all study levels. It is closely based on the standard \LaTeX{} \texttt{report} document class as well as previous thesis templates.

The purpose of the present document is threefold. It should serve (i) as a description of the document class, (ii) as an example of how to use it, and (iii) as a thesis template.
