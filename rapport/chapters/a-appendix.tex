\section{Additional Material}
\label{app:additional}

Additional material that does not fit in the main thesis but may still be relevant to share, e.g., raw data from experiments and surveys, code listings, additional plots, pre-project reports, project agreements, contracts, logs etc., can be put in appendices. Simply issue the command \texttt{\textbackslash appendix} in the main \texttt{.tex} file, and make one section per appendix.

If the appendix is in the form of a ready-made PDF file, it should be supported by a small descriptive text, and included using the \texttt{\textbackslash includepdf[]\{\}} command provided by the \texttt{pdfpages} package. Use the option \texttt{[pages=-]} to include all pages of the PDF document, or, e.g., \texttt{[pages=2-4]} to include only the given page range.
